# Backup Restoration Policy

# Introduction

The purpose of this document is to explain the procedures that must be followed in case of a data loss.

**Attention: It is strictly prohibited to apply the steps listed below by an unauthorized person**

## Backup Locations and Procedures

This ansible repository is used to configure targeted virtual machines, that are listed in the `hosts` file. For starting the vm configuration process, `ansible-playbook infra.yaml` command can be executed.

The `mysql` and `influxdb` roles include tasks to initiate periodic backups, which can be found in `roles > mysql > files > cron-mysql-backup` and `roles > influxdb > files > cron-influxdb-backup`. The periodic `mysql` task exports the content in `agama` database while `influxdb` task exports data in the `telegraf` database. The backup processes create two different backup types, `full` and `incremental`.

### MySQL and InfluxDB Dump 
* MySQL dump works on: `everyday at 20.e00 UTC`
* MySQL dump destionation path: `/home/backup/mysql/`
* InfluxDB dump works on: `everyday at 21.e00 UTC`
* InfluxDB dump destionation path: `/home/backup/influxdb`

The exported files are the main backup files and stored locally. These files are also used to create backups in remote destinations (backup server).

### Full Backups
* MySQL full backup schedule: `Every Sunday at 20.15 UTC`
* InfluxDB full backup schedule: `Every Sunday at 21.15 UTC`

Full backups are stored in the backup server.

* MySQL full backup destination path: `/home/EmreKaratopuk/mysql`
* InfluxDB full backup destination path: `/home/EmreKaratopuk/influxdb`

### Incremental Backups
* MySQL incremental backup schedule: `Everyday excluding Sunday at 20.20 UTC`
* InfluxDB incremental backup schedule: `Everyday excluding  Sunday at 21.20 UTC`

Full backups are stored in the backup server and in the same location as their associated full backups.

## Important Notes Before Following Recovery Procedures

* If the recovery files already exist in the `/home/backup/restore/*` destination directories, copying the backup data from the backup server will fail. Thus make sure that recovery files do not exist in the destination directories.

* If the vms were configured around 15 minutes ago, the step copying the backup data from the backup server may show an error indicating the backup server cannot identify the connecting machine thus cannot establish a connection. This is because the newly created public ssh key in the second vm have not been copied to the backup server. This problem would be resolved once the lecture bot copies the public key to the `authorized_keys` file in the backup server. The expected problem resolution time is approximately 20 minutes.

## MySQL Recovery Steps

* Copy the backup file from the backup server to the ` /home/backup/restore/mysql` location in the second vm:

    ```bash
    sudo -u backup duplicity --no-encryption restore rsync://EmreKaratopuk@backup.istikbal.ek/mysql /home/backup/restore/mysql
    ```

* Copy the backup data to the agama database in mysql with:
    ```bash
    sudo mysql agama < /home/backup/restore/mysql/agama.sql
    ```

In case backup server is not accessible, please check if `agama.sql` file exists in the `/home/backup/mysql/` directory as a local backup.

In the end of these steps, the mysql data should be recovered successfully. This can be confirmed by checking listed items on the agama website 

## InfluxDB Recovery Steps

* Copy the backup file from the backup server to the ` /home/backup/restore/influxdb` location in the second vm:

    ```bash
    sudo -u backup duplicity --no-encryption restore rsync://EmreKaratopuk@backup.istikbal.ek/influxdb /home/backup/restore/influxdb
    ```

* Stop the `telegraf service`:
    ```bash
    service telegraf stop
    ```

* Delete `telegragf` database from `influxdb`
    ```bash
    influx -execute 'DROP DATABASE telegraf'
    ```
* Restore `influxdb` data:
    ```bash
    sudo influxd restore -portable -database telegraf /home/backup/restore/influxdb
    ```

You may get these errors while restoring the database: 
```
error updating meta: DB metadata not changed. database may already exist
restore: DB metadata not changed. database may already exist
```
It's a known issue with InfluxDB restore, therefore errors can be ignored. You just need to make sure that the telegraf database is restored correctly.

In the end of these steps, the influxdb data should be recovered successfully. This can be confirmed by checking the `Syslog` dashboard on `Grafana`.

After following the reqiured recovery steps above, please execute the `ansible-playbook infra.yaml` command to avoid bugs and preserve the consistency in vms.
